# Mini_project
RGUKT_SKLM mini project done by Rajarshi Rayi(S171100)
This project is based on the Traffic Violation Control via Image Processing and Face Detection.
> The role of this project is to detect the face and recognize the face and analyze the expression of the faces
1. For Face detection we use the "Haar cascade frontal face" file 
2. For Face recoginisation we use the Face encoding from the Face_recognition libray
3. For Face expression analysis we use the DeepFace analysis
Lets Jump In to the project:
### Objective:
1. You will learn how to detect the faces for photos or live demo
2. You will learn how to recognize the face.
3. You will learn how to analyze the faces.
4. You can complete the project with the help of this.

### System Requriements:
1. Anaconda Navigator
   - For Creating the environment for live file.
2. Jupyter Notebook
   - For creating the code and processing the code.
3. Opencv python libray
   - Used for processing the images and for using of live video demo for our project.
4. Face_recognition libray
   - Used for find the encoding of the faces and recognize the faces.
5. deepface libray 
   - Used for analysis of the faces and returns the dominant emotions such as expressionof the faces.
6. Datasets 
   - for Recognizing of faces.
7. Haar cascade file.
   - for detecting the faces.
 
**Note**: Here we will not discuss the training of the images because of it takes lots of time. And recommended Training algorithm is CNN(Convitional Neural Networks)

**First Step is to download the data which is given in the github**

And Extract the file.

**Step 2:**
Install Anaconda Navigator. Before that you need to collect the images to recognition.

**Step 3:**
Now Follow the User-manual instruction you will get the idea of how to do the process.

**Note:**
I only showed the process in my visulization only but you can do more if you know how to do. Never stop learning.
